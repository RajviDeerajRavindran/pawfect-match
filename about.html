    <h2>About Pawfect Match</h2>
    <p>Pawfect Match is dedicated to connecting loving humans with pets in need. While people can adopt dogs and cats, our primary focus is rescuing stray dogs across India. We provide a platform where every pet has a chance for a loving home, and communities are safer and more compassionate. Using our lightweight JSON-based backend and modern deployment practices, we ensure a smooth, accessible, and interactive experience for all users.</p>
